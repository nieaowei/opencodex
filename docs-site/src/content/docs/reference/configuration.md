title: Configuration Reference
description: Every field in ~/.opencodex/config.json — top-level options, providers, and sidecars.
---

opencodex is configured by `~/.opencodex/config.json`. It's written by `ocx init` and the dashboard,
but you can edit it directly; the proxy reloads it on start. If the file cannot be parsed (e.g.
truncated or invalid JSON), opencodex backs it up to `config.json.invalid-<timestamp>`, prints a
console warning, and starts with defaults. Missing files also fall back to a default (a single
`openai` forward provider).

## Top level (`OcxConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `port` | `number` | `10100` | Port the proxy listens on. |
| `hostname?` | `string` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Bind address. Set `"0.0.0.0"` to expose on the LAN (requires `OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN`; see [Remote access](#remote-access) below). |
| `proxy?` | `string` | — | Outbound HTTP(S) proxy URL or `${ENV_VAR}` reference. Applied to `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` when those env vars are unset; loopback stays in `NO_PROXY`. |
| `providers` | `Record<string, OcxProviderConfig>` | — | Map of provider name → config. |
| `defaultProvider` | `string` | `"openai"` | Provider used when routing finds no better match. |
| `subagentModels?` | `string[]` | `gpt-5.5`, GPT-5.6 trio, `gpt-5.4-mini` | Up to 5 native slugs or `provider/model` ids featured first in Codex's subagent picker. Also injected into v2 delegation guidance as the available-model roster, annotated with the effort ladder each entry advertises in the catalog. An explicit empty list is preserved. |
| `injectionModel?` | `string` | — | Preferred native or routed model named in the injected multi-agent guidance (v2 surface); delegation is told to pass this exact model to `spawn_agent` with `fork_turns: "none"`. |
| `injectionEffort?` | `string` | — | Preferred `spawn_agent` reasoning effort (`low` through `ultra`). Only meaningful with `injectionModel`. |
| `effortCap?` | `string` | — | Hard per-request ceiling for reasoning effort. A multi-agent V2 feature: it applies to main turns whose own tool list carries the V2 collab surface, plus spawned-child turns marked with exactly `x-openai-subagent: collab_spawn` or `"subagent_kind": "thread_spawn"` in `x-codex-turn-metadata` (marked children qualify regardless of their own tool surface). Plain and V1-surface main turns are untouched, compaction turns always bypass caps, and `multiAgentMode: "v1"` disables caps entirely (the Dashboard hides the panel). Accepts `low` through `ultra`; caps only lower, never raise. Snaps down to the highest supported rung at or below the cap. If the model exposes no effort control, or no supported rung fits under the cap, the effort field is removed and the provider default applies. `max` and `ultra` are accepted but do not impose a lower rank ceiling (requests arrive as `low` through `max` after the client's `ultra` → `max` conversion), though known model ladders may still cause snap-down or strip. The Dashboard picker offers `low` through `xhigh`. Managed via `GET /api/effort-caps` and `PUT /api/effort-caps`. |
| `subagentEffortCap?` | `string` | — | The same hard ceiling, applied only to spawned-child turns identified by codex-rs markers matched exactly: `x-openai-subagent: collab_spawn` or `"subagent_kind": "thread_spawn"` in `x-codex-turn-metadata`. Other internal sub-agent categories (review, compaction, memory consolidation) never trip this cap, and `multiAgentMode: "v1"` disables it entirely. Accepts `low` through `ultra`; when both caps are set, the lower one wins, and caps only lower, never raise. Snaps down to the highest supported rung at or below the cap. If the model exposes no effort control, or no supported rung fits under the cap, the effort field is removed and the provider default applies. `max` and `ultra` are accepted but do not impose a lower rank ceiling (requests arrive as `low` through `max` after the client's `ultra` → `max` conversion), though known model ladders may still cause snap-down or strip. The Dashboard picker offers `low` through `xhigh`. Managed via `GET /api/effort-caps` and `PUT /api/effort-caps`. |
| `injectionPrompt?` | `string` | — | Custom override for the injected v2 guidance body. Replaces the built-in text; `{{model}}`, `{{effort}}`, and `{{roster}}` placeholders are substituted. Firing gates are unchanged. Settable via `PUT /api/injection-model` (`prompt` key). |
| `disabledModels?` | `string[]` | — | Models hidden from Codex. Routed `provider/model` ids are excluded from the catalog and `/v1/models`; bare native GPT slugs (e.g. `gpt-5.4`) flip their catalog entry to `visibility: "hide"` and drop from the bare `/v1/models` list. Toggleable per model from the dashboard Models page. |
| `multiAgentMode?` | `"v1" \| "default" \| "v2"` | `"default"` | 3-state multi-agent surface override. `"v1"` forces all models to the v1 surface (overrides upstream pins); `"default"` respects upstream model pins (sol/terra=v2, luna=v1); `"v2"` forces all models to v2. Settable from the dashboard Models page or `ocx v2 mode`. |
| `providerContextCaps?` | `Record<string,number>` | `{}` | Per-provider Codex-visible context caps. A cap only lowers known context windows. |
| `contextCapValue?` | `number` | `350000` | Value used by the dashboard's context-cap controls; changing it updates every enabled entry in `providerContextCaps`. |
| `stallTimeoutSec?` | `number` | `90` | Seconds without upstream data before the bridge aborts and emits `response.incomplete`. Minimum 1. |
| `connectTimeoutMs?` | `number` | `200000` | Per-attempt deadline for DNS/TCP/TLS and final response headers only; it ends before response-body generation. |
| `shutdownTimeoutMs?` | `number` | `5000` | Graceful drain deadline before active turns are aborted. |
| `websockets?` | `boolean` | `false` | Advertise `supports_websockets` so Codex uses the Responses WebSocket path. Omit or set `false` to keep HTTP/SSE. |
| `apiKeys?` | `OcxApiKey[]` | `[]` | Additional generated `ocx_…` credentials accepted by management and data-plane auth on non-loopback binds. Managed by the dashboard; entry fields are listed below. |
| `codexAutoStart?` | `boolean` | `true` | Let the Codex shim run `ocx ensure` before launching Codex. `false` makes `ocx ensure` a no-op. |
| `syncResumeHistory?` | `boolean` | `true` | Reversible Codex App history compatibility mode. opencodex backs up original Codex thread metadata, remaps old OpenAI interactive rows to `opencodex`, and temporarily promotes opencodex-created `exec` rows to an app-visible source. `ocx stop` / `ocx restore` restore backed-up OpenAI rows and eject remaining opencodex user threads to OpenAI so native Codex can resume them after the proxy is removed from `config.toml`. Set `false` to opt out. |
| `codexAccounts?` | `CodexAccount[]` | `[]` | ChatGPT/Codex pool account metadata managed by the Codex Auth dashboard. Secrets live separately in `codex-accounts.json`. |
| `activeCodexAccountId?` | `string` | — | Pool account used for the next new Codex thread. Existing thread affinities keep their original account. |
| `autoSwitchThreshold?` | `number` | `80` | Usage percent threshold for new-session auto-switching. The score uses the hottest known 5h, weekly, or 30d quota window. Set `0` to disable quota auto-switching. |
| `upstreamFailoverThreshold?` | `number` | `3` | Consecutive transient upstream failures before future new sessions fail over to another eligible pool account. Set `0` to disable failure failover. |
| `modelCacheTtlMs?` | `number` | `300000` | Freshness window for the per-provider `/models` cache (5 min). |
| `cacheRetention?` | `"none" \| "short" \| "long"` | `"short"` | Anthropic prompt-cache policy: disabled, 5-minute ephemeral, or 1-hour extended. |
| `webSearchSidecar?` | `OcxWebSearchSidecarConfig` | on | Web-search sidecar options (see below). |
| `visionSidecar?` | `OcxVisionSidecarConfig` | on | Vision sidecar options (see below). |
| `tokenGuardian?` | `OcxTokenGuardianConfig` | off | Optional proactive OAuth refresh and Codex-account warmup policy; fields are listed below. |
| `corsAllowOrigins?` | `string[]` | `[]` | Additional exact origins allowed by CORS. Loopback origins are always allowed. |

`maxConcurrentThreadsPerSession` is the camel-case field used by `PUT /api/v2`, not a
`config.json` key. `ocx v2 threads <n>` persists the corresponding
`max_concurrent_threads_per_session` value under `[features.multi_agent_v2]` in Codex's
`$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`; enable v2 first so that table exists.

If an older development build already ran `syncResumeHistory` before backup support existed, you can
also force the same native-provider recovery with `ocx recover-history --legacy-openai`.

:::note[Codex account pool]
Use the dashboard's **Codex Auth** page to add pool accounts and refresh quotas. The config stores
non-secret account metadata only; access and refresh tokens are kept in the hardened Codex account
credential store. Existing thread ids keep account affinity, while new sessions can auto-route based
on quota, cooldown, and health.
:::

### Managed record shapes

`apiKeys[]` entries contain `id: string`, `name: string`, the generated `key: string`, and an ISO
`createdAt: string`. `codexAccounts[]` entries contain required `id`, `email`, and `isMain` fields,
plus optional `plan`, `chatgptAccountId`, and privacy-safe `logLabel` strings. These records are
normally dashboard-managed.

### `tokenGuardian` (`OcxTokenGuardianConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled?` | `boolean` | `false` | Global proactive-refresh switch. |
| `tickSeconds?` | `number` | `21600` | Sweep interval (6 hours, minimum 60 seconds). |
| `jitterSeconds?` | `number` | `300` | Random delay added before a sweep. |
| `concurrency?` | `number` | `3` | Maximum simultaneous refreshes per sweep. |
| `leadSeconds?` | `number` | `900` | Extra refresh lead time beyond one tick. |
| `failureBackoffBaseSeconds?` | `number` | `300` | Initial transient-failure backoff. |
| `failureBackoffMaxSeconds?` | `number` | `3600` | Backoff ceiling and permanent-failure delay. |
| `codexWarmupEnabled?` | `boolean` | `false` | Opt into synthetic Codex pool-account validation. |
| `codexWarmupMaxAgeSeconds?` | `number` | `691200` | Revalidate an account after 8 days. |
| `codexWarmupModel?` | `string` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Native model used for optional warmup. |

## Remote access

By default opencodex binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback only). When `hostname` is set to a non-loopback
address such as `0.0.0.0`, opencodex enforces token authentication on **both** the management API
(`/api/*`) and the data-plane (`/v1/responses`).

Set the `OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable before starting:

```bash
export OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN="your-secret-token"
ocx start
```

The proxy refuses to start without this variable when binding beyond loopback. If you install a
background service for LAN access, export the same variable before `ocx service install` so launchd,
systemd, or Task Scheduler receives it. Clients must include the token in every request via the
`x-opencodex-api-key` header:

```
x-opencodex-api-key: your-secret-token
```

An `Authorization: Bearer …` header is also accepted. Dashboard-generated `apiKeys` may be used in
place of the environment token after startup; all candidates are compared in constant time
(`timingSafeEqual`) to prevent timing side-channels.

:::caution[LAN exposure]
Binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes your proxy — and all configured provider credentials — to the local
network. Only do this on trusted networks, and always set a strong `OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN`.
:::

## Providers (`OcxProviderConfig`)

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `adapter` | `string` | One of `openai-chat`, `openai-responses`, `anthropic`, `google`, `kiro`, `cursor`, `azure-openai` (or alias `azure`). |
| `baseUrl` | `string` | Upstream API base URL. |
| `disabled?` | `boolean` | Keep the provider on disk but exclude it from routing and model/catalog listings. |
| `apiKey?` | `string` | API key, or an `${ENV_VAR}` / `$ENV_VAR` reference resolved at request time. |
| `apiKeyPool?` | `ApiKeyPoolEntry[]` | Multi-key pool. `apiKey` mirrors the active entry; each item has `id`, `key`, optional `label`, and optional numeric `addedAt`. |
| `defaultModel?` | `string` | Model used when this provider is selected without an explicit model. |
| `models?` | `string[]` | Seed/fallback model list. When `liveModels` is `false`, these are the only discovered models. |
| `liveModels?` | `boolean` | Fetch the provider's live `/models` catalog on start/sync (default `true`). Set `false` to use only configured `models`. |
| `selectedModels?` | `string[]` | Catalog allowlist applied after discovery. A non-empty list exposes only those ids to Codex; empty/omitted exposes all discovered models. |
| `contextWindow?` | `number` | Provider-wide Codex-visible context-window cap for routed catalog entries. Live metadata below this value is kept. |
| `modelContextWindows?` | `Record<string,number>` | Model-specific context-window caps. These override `contextWindow` for matching model ids and never raise smaller live metadata. |
| `modelInputModalities?` | `Record<string,string[]>` | Model-specific catalog input hints such as `["text"]` or `["text", "image"]`. |
| `headers?` | `Record<string,string>` | Extra upstream headers. Authorization, cookies, API-key headers, embedded newlines, and invalid header names are rejected. |
| `authMode?` | `"key" \| "forward" \| "oauth"` | How to authenticate (default `key`). See [Providers](/opencodex/guides/providers/#auth-modes). |
| `refreshPolicy?` | `"proactive" \| "lazy-only" \| "disabled"` | Override this OAuth provider's Token Guardian policy. |
| `reasoningEfforts?` | `string[]` | Provider-wide Codex reasoning labels to advertise and send (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `ultra`). |
| `modelReasoningEfforts?` | `Record<string,string[]>` | Model-specific reasoning labels. An empty list hides the effort control for that model. |
| `reasoningEffortMap?` | `Record<string,string>` | Provider-wide wire aliases for reasoning labels. Use only when the upstream expects a different value. |
| `modelReasoningEffortMap?` | `Record<string,Record<string,string>>` | Model-specific wire aliases for reasoning labels. |
| `noReasoningModels?` | `string[]` | Models that reject a reasoning/thinking param — the adapter drops `reasoning_effort` for them. |
| `noTemperatureModels?` | `string[]` | Models that reject caller-specified `temperature`. |
| `noTopPModels?` | `string[]` | Models that reject caller-specified `top_p`. |
| `noPenaltyModels?` | `string[]` | Models that reject presence/frequency penalties. |
| `parallelToolCalls?` | `boolean` | Enable/disable parallel tool calls. OpenAI Chat defaults on; non-chat adapters advertise support only on explicit `true`. |
| `autoToolChoiceOnlyModels?` | `string[]` | Models whose `tool_choice` accepts only `auto` or `none`; forced/named choices are downgraded. |
| `preserveReasoningContentModels?` | `string[]` | Models that require prior assistant `reasoning_content` to remain in chat history. |
| `thinkingToggleModels?` | `string[]` | Chat models using a vendor `thinking.enabled` toggle instead of an effort ladder. |
| `thinkingBudgetModels?` | `string[]` | Chat models using an integer `thinking_budget`; effort is mapped to a budget fraction. |
| `noVisionModels?` | `string[]` | Text-only models — the [vision sidecar](/opencodex/guides/sidecars/) describes images for them. Matching tolerates an Ollama `:size` tag. |
| `escapeBuiltinToolNames?` | `boolean` | Anthropic-compatible gateways such as Umans can require tool-name escaping on the wire; opencodex strips the prefix before returning tool calls to Codex. |
| `googleMode?` | `"ai-studio" \| "vertex" \| "cloud-code-assist"` | Google transport/auth mode. Default `ai-studio`. |
| `project?` | `string` | Vertex project id or Antigravity Cloud Code Assist project id. |
| `location?` | `string` | Vertex location; environment fallback is `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`. |
| `mcpServers?` | `Record<string,CursorMcpServerConfig>` | **Cursor only.** MCP servers started over stdio or reached over Streamable HTTP; fields are listed below. |
| `desktopExecutor?` | `DesktopExecutorConfig` | **Cursor only.** External computer-use/record-screen commands; fields are listed below. |
| `unsafeAllowNativeLocalExec?` | `boolean` | **Cursor adapter only.** Opt-in escape hatch for Cursor server-driven local `read` / `write` / `delete` / `ls` / `grep` / `shell` / `fetch` execution. Defaults to `false` so remote Cursor messages cannot bypass Codex approval and sandbox enforcement. See [Cursor provider](#cursor-provider-adapter-cursor) below. |

## Cursor provider (`adapter: "cursor"`)

The Cursor bridge is experimental. After `ocx login cursor`, add or edit the `cursor` entry under
`providers` in `~/.opencodex/config.json` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.opencodex\config.json`).

By default, Cursor's server-driven native local tools stay **disabled**. Codex keeps using its own
tools (`apply_patch`, `exec_command`, and so on) with approval and sandbox policy. Set
`unsafeAllowNativeLocalExec` only for trusted local experiments where you accept that Cursor may
read, write, delete, list, grep, shell, or fetch on your machine **without** Codex's approval path.

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "cursor": {
      "adapter": "cursor",
      "baseUrl": "https://api2.cursor.sh",
      "authMode": "oauth",
      "defaultModel": "auto",
      "unsafeAllowNativeLocalExec": true
    }
  }
}
```

The flag belongs on the **provider object** (`providers.cursor`), not at the top level of
`config.json`.

You can also set it from the [web dashboard](/opencodex/guides/web-dashboard/): **Providers →
Cursor → Edit JSON**, add `"unsafeAllowNativeLocalExec": true`, save, then restart the proxy
(`ocx restart` or `ocx stop` + `ocx start`).

MCP, screen recording, and computer-use use separate `mcpServers` / `desktopExecutor` config and are
not controlled by this flag.

### Cursor integration records

Each `mcpServers.<name>` value accepts either `command` (stdio) or `url` (Streamable HTTP). Stdio
entries also accept `args?: string[]`, `env?: Record<string,string>`, and `cwd?: string`; HTTP entries
accept `headers?: Record<string,string>`. Both forms support `enabled?: boolean` (default true) and
`toolPrefix?: string`.

`desktopExecutor` accepts `computerUseCommand?`, `recordScreenCommand?`, `cwd?`,
`env?: Record<string,string>`, and `timeoutMs?` (default `30000`). Commands run through `sh -c`, read
one JSON request from stdin, and must write one JSON result to stdout.

:::caution[Security]
Leave `unsafeAllowNativeLocalExec` unset or `false` unless you explicitly want Cursor-native local
execution that bypasses Codex approval and sandbox semantics.
:::

## Static model allowlists

Some providers expose very large or slow live model catalogs. Set `liveModels` to `false` when you
want Codex to see only the models pinned in `models`:

When `liveModels` is `false` and `models` is empty or omitted, opencodex exposes no routed models
for that provider.

Use `selectedModels` for a different purpose: discovery still runs, but only the selected ids are
published to Codex's catalog and `/v1/models`. The dashboard's full model list remains available so
the allowlist can be changed later.

Preview GPT-5.6 fallback entries use the same mechanism. The OpenAI API-key preset seeds
`gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`; the OpenRouter preset seeds the same models as
`openai/gpt-5.6-sol`, `openai/gpt-5.6-terra`, and `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`. Both presets attach
model-specific `modelContextWindows` values of `372000`, and the synced Codex catalog advertises
`max` reasoning while keeping `xhigh` distinct. Leave `liveModels` on to merge live provider results
with those explicit additions, or set it to `false` to expose only `models`.

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "adapter": "openai-chat",
      "baseUrl": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "apiKey": "${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}",
      "liveModels": false,
      "models": ["deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash", "qwen/qwen3-coder-plus"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Sidecars

### `webSearchSidecar` (`OcxWebSearchSidecarConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled?` | `boolean` | on when a forward provider + login exist | Master switch. |
| `model?` | `string` | `gpt-5.6-luna` | The sidecar model running real `web_search` (must be a native ChatGPT model). Explicit legacy `gpt-5.4-mini` values are migrated on start. |
| `reasoning?` | `string` | `low` | Reasoning effort for the sidecar (`minimal` is rejected with web search). |
| `maxSearchesPerTurn?` | `number` | `3` | Total real searches per main-model turn (loop guard). |
| `routedModelStallTimeoutMs?` | `number` | `200000` | Config-file-only continuous raw response-byte inactivity deadline for each routed-model iteration. Must be an integer from `1` through `2147483647`; every non-empty response-body chunk resets it. |
| `timeoutMs?` | `number` | `200000` | Separate deadline for one hosted web-search request. |

The web-search path has four clocks: the base bridge event-stall budget (`stallTimeoutSec`), the
DNS/TCP/TLS/final-header budget (`connectTimeoutMs`), routed-model raw-byte inactivity
(`routedModelStallTimeoutMs`), and one hosted search (`timeoutMs`). Its effective bridge watchdog is
`max(base stall, connect timeout, routed-model stall, sidecar timeout) + 30 seconds`. The routed
stall is an inactivity guard, not a total generation timeout.

### `visionSidecar` (`OcxVisionSidecarConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled?` | `boolean` | on when a forward provider + login exist | Master switch. |
| `model?` | `string` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Vision model that describes images (must accept image input). |
| `timeoutMs?` | `number` | `45000` | Sidecar fetch timeout. |

:::tip[Secrets]
Prefer `${ENV_VAR}` references for keys so `config.json` stays free of secrets. OAuth and forward
providers store no key at all.
:::

:::note[Atomic writes]
All config and catalog files (`config.toml`, `opencodex-catalog.json`) are written atomically via
`atomicWriteFile` (temp file + rename). This prevents half-written files when concurrent writers —
e.g. `ocx stop` and the proxy's own shutdown handler — both restore Codex at the same time.
